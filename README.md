# fincrime project: online payment fraud detection

I am going through this tutorial ([link here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/online-payment-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-in-python/)) which uses machine learning (ML) to detect fraud in online payments. I will be using this tutorial to learn about supervised machine learning and the specific types such as classification and regression. Additionally, the online payment fraud detection tutorial will also teach me about creating training and testing datasets during the ML model training process.
