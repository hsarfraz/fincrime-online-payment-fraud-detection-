# fincrime project: online payment fraud detection

I am going through this tutorial ([link here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/online-payment-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-in-python/)) which uses machine learning (ML) to detect fraud in online payments. I will be using this tutorial to learn about supervised machine learning and the specific types such as classification and regression. Additionally, the online payment fraud detection tutorial will also teach me about creating training and testing datasets during the ML model training process.

## Logistic Regression (supervised learning algorithm used for classification)

<ins> Logistic Regression </ins>

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting a binary (yes/no) outcome based on one or more independent variables. In the context of machine learning, this would be a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. Specifically, predicting the probability of a binary outcome
