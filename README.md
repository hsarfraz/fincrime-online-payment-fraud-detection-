This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions using the PaySim dataset.

The workflow includes:

* Data loading & preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature engineering
* Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Evaluation (ROC-AUC, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
* Saving & loading trained models
* Predicting fraud on all transactions

Models Trained

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

Each model was evaluated using:

* ROC-AUC
* Precision
* Recall
* Confusion Matrix

Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Better feature engineering
* Handling class imbalance
* Threshold optimization
* Deploying model via API

# fincrime project: online payment fraud detection

I am going through this tutorial ([link here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/online-payment-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-in-python/)) which uses machine learning (ML) to detect fraud in online payments. I will be using this tutorial to learn about supervised machine learning and the specific types such as classification and regression. Additionally, the online payment fraud detection tutorial will also teach me about creating training and testing datasets during the ML model training process.
