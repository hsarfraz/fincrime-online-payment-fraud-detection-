# fincrime project: online payment fraud detection

I am going through this tutorial ([link here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/online-payment-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-in-python/)) which uses machine learning (ML) to detect fraud in online payments. I will be using this tutorial to learn about supervised machine learning and the specific types such as classification and regression. Additionally, the online payment fraud detection tutorial will also teach me about creating training and testing datasets during the ML model training process.

## SVM (Support Vector Machines) (supervised learning algorithm used for classification & regression)

A machine learning algorithm that helps us find the best decision boundary to split our space into classes.[Here is a video which talks about support vector machines in greater detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0lQVaxLyv4&list=PLulEtxNA34XSV4kZzulnKMFenJB-TnGrt) 

* SVM are mainly used for categorization tasks.
* The support vectors (in the graph below) are called support vectors since they support the decision boundary. In other words, the support vectors support the way the algorithm is being built
* The maximum margin is the sum of the two distances from the maximum margin hyperplane to the support vectors
