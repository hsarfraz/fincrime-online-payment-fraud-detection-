# fincrime project: online payment fraud detection

I am going through this tutorial ([link here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/online-payment-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-in-python/)) which uses machine learning (ML) to detect fraud in online payments. I will be using this tutorial to learn about supervised machine learning and the specific types such as classification and regression. Additionally, the online payment fraud detection tutorial will also teach me about creating training and testing datasets during the ML model training process.

| Machine Learning Algorithm  | Overview |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/hsarfraz/fincrime-online-payment-fraud-detection-/blob/main/logistic%20regression.md)  | supervised learning algorithm used for classification  | 
| XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)  | supervised learning algorithm used for classification & regression  |



## XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) (supervised learning algorithm used for classification & regression)

A machine learning algorithm that gradually increases its accuracy through training. Gradient boosting is applied on top of another machine learning algorithm. It involves two types of models ([link to source from Google which talks about XGBoost in greater detail](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests/intro-to-gbdt))

* a weak ML model which is typically a decision tree
* s strong ML model which composes of multiple weak models

The residual is the difference between the actual data points and predicted values (actual - predicted = residual). The predicted values are the data points on the regression line (line of best fit)
