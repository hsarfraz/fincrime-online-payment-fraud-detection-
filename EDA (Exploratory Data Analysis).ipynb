    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the \"paysim\" dataset for this project which can be found on kaggle (here is the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mtalaltariq/paysim-data) to the dataset). The PaySim dataset is a **synthetic** financial transaction dataset that simulates mobile money operations based on real transactional patterns. It was generated using aggregated and anonymized data from a mobile financial service provider (ex. JazzCash and Easypaisa). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is commonly used for fraud detection research and machine learning model training, allowing analysts and data scientists to explore techniques for identifying suspicious or fraudulent activity without using real customer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins> Difference between a mobile financial system and digital bank </ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "A mobile financial system (or mobile money service) is not a traditional bank. These services are typically operated by telecommunications providers, not by licensed banks. While they offer bank-like features—such as money transfers, bill payments, and mobile wallet storage—they are not registered financial institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key distinction lies in access and structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mobile financial systems are SIM card–based, allowing users to send and receive money using their mobile phone number without needing a formal bank account.\n",
    "* In contrast, digital banks require users to open an official bank account, identified by an account number, and are regulated under banking laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, mobile money services primarily focus on payments and transfers, whereas banks provide a broader range of services, such as savings accounts, loans, interest-bearing deposits, and official bank statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins> How are the rules to detect financial fraud formulated? </ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main institutions that define the rules to detect financial crime. These institutions are governments, international bodies, and banks/mobile financial systems/ fintechs. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Institution | Purpose | \n",
    "| :------- | :------: | \n",
    "| Governments  | Define the legal requierments (ex. report financial crime)  | \n",
    "| International bodies (ICA, CFCS, ACAMS)  | Define the frameworks on how to identify fradulent transactions  | \n",
    "| Banks/Fintechs/Mobile banking providers  | Define the actual rules on how to flag certain transactions as fradulent  | \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \\\\$10,000 thereshold rule\n",
    "\n",
    "* The government defined the \\\\$10,000 threshold rule in the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970, requiring financial institutions to report large transactions. \n",
    "* The international bodies then came in to set guidelines that inform other banks, fintechs, and mobile banking providers on how they should use this new law. For example, international bodies say how financial institutions should have systems in place to detect unusual activity over \\\\$10,000. \n",
    "* The banks/fintechs/mobile banking providers would then establish internal systems to automatically detect and flag any transaction that is over \\\\$10,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "<ins> What are some rules with indicate fraudulent transactions? </ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be impossible to list down the specific rules, to detect financial crime, that each individual financial institution has set in place since each institution has kept their rules and methods in detecting financial crime to be private to maintain a competitive advantage in the market and to also prevent criminals from finding work arounds in the financial system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial institutions implement internal fraud detection systems based on government regulations (e.g., the \\\\$10,000 threshold rule) and international guidance (FATF, ICA, ACAMS). While governments and international bodies provide legal and framework-level requirements, each institution may design its own monitoring strategies and thresholds to identify potentially fraudulent activity. Specific internal methods are proprietary, and banks do not publicly disclose them to maintain competitive advantage and prevent abuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Governments set legally binding rules and reporting requirements, such as the $10,000 threshold rule, which requires institutions to flag or report transactions above a certain amount.\n",
    "* International bodies (e.g., FATF, ACAMS, CFCS, ICA) issue guidelines and typologies describing methods that criminals use to launder money or commit fraud — such as smurfing (structuring transactions to avoid thresholds) and the use of shell companies (fake or inactive businesses used to conceal ownership or move illicit funds).\n",
    "    \n",
    "<ins> What machine learning models are used to detect fradulent transactions? </ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models for fraud detection are typically divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches, depending on whether the dataset contains labels that identify which transactions are fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning Models**: These models are trained using labeled data — where each transaction is marked as fraudulent or legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Decision Trees / Random Forests (classification)\n",
    "* Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
    "* Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns patterns from the labeled data and applies these patterns to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent.\n",
    "(Example: The PaySim dataset is synthetic and labeled, so it can be used to train supervised models.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning Models**: These are used when fraud labels are not available. The model attempts to find unusual patterns or “anomalies” in the data that deviate from normal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)\n",
    "* Autoencoders (Dimensionality Reduction)\n",
    "* Isolation Forest\n",
    "* One-Class SVM (Anomaly Detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are effective in real-world banking environments where fraudulent behavior is rare and constantly evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many financial institutions use hybrid systems, combining supervised and unsupervised models. For example, an anomaly detection system might flag suspicious transactions, and a supervised model can then classify whether those are likely to be fraudulent."
